##### Order Flow – Market Participants
Most people get confused when they open an Order Flow chart for the very first time. There is no shame in that. Order Flow shows so much information that it is easy to get overwhelmed if you don’t know what to look for! Don’t worry though; by the time you have finished this book, you will be able to read Order Flow without getting a headache :) Let’s start by going through the basic stuff, like what Order Flow shows and how to read it.

##### Passive vs. Active (Aggressive) Market Participants
To learn what is going on in the Order Flow chart, you first need to understand one fundamental thing: the distinction between passive and active market participants. This may sound like too much theory, but this piece of information is vital. If you are not sure you got it the first time, go through it again. If you don’t get this point now, you will be lost later. Ready? Here we go! Passive Market Participants

##### Passive Market Participants
Passive market participants are traders who enter their trade with a limit (pending) order.
- They do not chase the market. They wait for the price to come to them and then they enter their trades only for the price they want (or better).
- Every subject in the market can be a passive participant. It does not matter if it is a bank, a pension fund, a hedge fund, or a private trader like you or me. It is merely everybody who enters a trade with a limit order. If you place a limit order in your trading platform, you are a passive market participant.
- When the price hits the limit order you placed in the market, the order gets filled, and you get into the trade (you have just opened a trading position). This trading position will show on the Order Flow footprint.
  - If you open a LONG position with a limit order, then it will appear on the BID side of the footprint (on the left).
  - If you opened a SHORT position with a limit order, then it will appear on the ASK side of the footprint (on the right).

##### Active Market Participants
- Active market participants are traders who enter their trades with market orders. If you press a market Buy or Sell, then you are an active market participant. Your position will get filled immediately.
- No matter where the price currently is, no matter where exactly the trade is going to be filled, aggressive participants just want in. Now! Even if this means risking a slippage (the trade won’t open precisely at the price where they pressed the Buy/Sell).
- A market order is useful in situations where there is no time to wait to get your whole position filled exactly at the price you wanted. For example, this could be when there is a quick price movement that you don’t want to miss. 
  - If you open a LONG position with a market order, it will appear on the ASK side of the footprint (on the right).
 - If you open a SHORT position with a market order, it will appear on the BID side of the footprint (on the left).

##### Intraday Scalp Strategy with [cignals.io](https://cignals.io)
******************************************************************
Before I discovered [cignals.io](https://cignals.io), I use combination confluences to build my strategy.  I'm new to order flow and still learning to read tape.  I've read few books recently, I some what understand it. I can't help you there. [cignals.io](https://cignals.io) can, it finds Imbalances for you, which is big part of tape reading.  What I do know, I can read Price Action, VSA, VPA, Volume Profile, & I understand theory behind SMC concept.  I've read few books on Wycoff theory. Using combination of these is how I trade.  Other thing I love about [cignals.io](https://cignals.io) is confirmation on ["Auction Theory"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b62FlkIvE9E&ab_channel=Cignals). Some times on traditional chart I'm not 100% if it fail or not!  

I'm Crypto Scalper, I hardly never swing trade due to market conditions. I prefer Range and Intraday until market back trending.  I trade off 30m, 15m, & 3m chart.

Check there [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@CignalsIO) channel out!  Great information there!

Here how I use [cignals.io](https://cignals.io) to my workflow.

 1. Determine trend
  - Look at 1D, 4H, 1H on signals for hints. "nPoC, EI, Buy-Side-Imbalance, Sell-Side-Imbalance, absorption etc etc"
  - Advance membership offers VWAP, Long & Short Ration, Open Interest, & more extra confluence on trades.

  - Picture of recent BTC chart, Like dream come true in my book!  You see something like this on any time frame!  It's area you defiantly pay attention to.  

2) Open 30m & 15m on [cignals.io](https://cignals.io), I change price Interval x4 of current Price Interval.  I like to see bigger picture of what's going on.
  - I usually use PoC, VaL, VaH from 30m.  Use 15m signals for key areas to pay attention too.

3) Alerts
  - Use Trading View to set alerts for key areas of Interest.
  - Also use Order Blocks from SMC from traditional charts to base where to set alerts.
  - Look for confluence on 15m [cignals.io](https://cignals.io) chart. Really nice when [cignals.io](https://cignals.io) signal in Order Block!
  - Yes, Order Block not Order Book!  I can see them on naked chart without drawing them.  Here picture of possible short setup I'm considering. Notice [cignals.io](https://cignals.io) signal ;-)
  - Use my techniques from part 1 on confluence if I'm going to enter or not after alert goes off.

4) Entry
- [cignals.io](https://cignals.io) lowest time frames are 5m & 1m.  I prefer 3m.  I use 5m.  1m moves to fast for me.  Out of conner of my eye I look at 3m chart for VSA & VPA reversal candles.  
- Look for confluence, VaL, VaH, Volume Spread, Order Book, etc etc etc.
- I lie setting trigger market order.  Let trade come to me.
- I prefer to wait for dead cat bounce.  See if there BoS on 3m.  Look for 2 candle close above or below depending on long or short.  Place trigger at Top or bottom of spread.  S/L at bottom of previous candle close.  I have good R/R and I'm not knife catching.
- [cignals.io](https://cignals.io) is added Confirmation.  
  - Total Volume - uses Volume Spread.
  -  DOM my favorite!  Love when it lights up like Christmas tree with orders favoriting direction of my trade.
  -  You can see order book and orders coming into exchange.  Lighter, means weak Order book.  Brighter, heavier orders are on book.

Final Thoughts, my trade strategy concept pretty easy.  Google your friend and do little research or find books.  Trading not Rocket Science, it's Art! Figure out what's best for you.  Hopefully you stack your bags!

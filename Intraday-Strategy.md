##### Intraday Scalp Strategy with [cignals.io](https://cignals.io)
******************************************************************
Before I discovered [cignals.io](https://cignals.io), I use combination confluences to build my strategy.  I use Price Action, VSA, VPA, Volume Profile, & I understand theory behind SMC concept.  I've read few books on Wycoff theory.  Using combination of these is how I was trading up tell last week.  

I'm new to order flow and still learning to read tape.  I've read few books recently; I somewhat understand it. I can't help you here.  I've highlighted below what you need to research. [cignals.io](https://cignals.io) can, it finds Imbalances for you, which is big part of tape reading.  Other thing I love about [cignals.io](https://cignals.io) is confirmation on ["Auction Theory"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b62FlkIvE9E&ab_channel=Cignals). Sometimes on traditional chart I'm not 100% if it fails or not!  Absorption where you will notice blocks on price chart where price has not move with relatively high volume.   Initiative will be market turn coming out absorption.  This is aggression, look for longs in ask column.  Aggression in bid column you look for shorts.
Short version of my knowledge.

Good example of Absorption turning into Aggression!  Up thrust from Volume Spread my indication to find entry.  I set market trigger at top of spread.  S/L will be at bottom of wick.  Or just below.

I trade off 30m, 15m, & 3m chart.

Check there [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@CignalsIO) channel out!  Great information there!

Here how I use [cignals.io](https://cignals.io) to my workflow.

 1. Determine trend
  - Look at 1D, 4H, 1H on signals for hints. "nPoC, EI, Buy-Side-Imbalance, Sell-Side-Imbalance, absorption etc etc"
  - Advance membership offers VWAP, Long & Short Ration, Open Interest, & more extra confluence on trades.

  - Picture of recent BTC chart, Multiple imbalance group together is dream come true in my book!  You see something like this on any time frame!  It's area you defiantly pay attention to.  

2) Open 30m & 15m on [cignals.io](https://cignals.io), I change price Interval x4 of current Price Interval.  I like to see bigger picture of what's going on.
  - I usually use PoC, VaL, VaH from 30m.  Use 15m signals for key areas to pay attention too.

3) Alerts
  - Use Trading View to set alerts for key areas of Interest.
  - Also use Order Blocks from SMC from traditional charts to base where to set alerts.
  - Yes, Order Block not Order Book!  I can see them on naked chart without drawing them.  Here picture of possible short setup I'm considering. Notice [cignals.io](https://cignals.io) signal ;-)
  - Look for confluence on 15m [cignals.io](https://cignals.io) chart. Really nice when [cignals.io](https://cignals.io) signal in Order Block!
  - Use my techniques from part 1 on confluence if I'm going to enter or not after alert goes off.

4) Entry
- [cignals.io](https://cignals.io) lowest time frames are 5m & 1m.  I prefer 3m.  I use 5m.  1m moves to fast for me.  Out of conner of my eye I look at 3m chart for VSA & VPA reversal candles.  
- First question I ask myself is it consolidating on lower timeframe. Is it accumulating or distributing!  That comes with understanding market structure.  You will see same pattern whether it's 3-minute chart or Daily chart.  Second is top of Range or Bottom of Range.
- Look for confluence for reversal, VaL, VaH, Volume Spread, Order Book, Imbalance, nPoC etc etc etc.
- I like setting trigger market order.  Let trade come to me.
- I prefer to wait for dead cat bounce.  See if there BoS on 3m.  Look for 2 candle close above or below depending on long or short.  Place trigger at Top or bottom of spread.  S/L at bottom of previous 15m candle close.  I have good R/R and I'm not knife catching.
- [cignals.io](https://cignals.io) is added Confirmation.  
  - Total Volume - uses Volume Spread.
  -  DOM my favorite!  Love when it lights up like Christmas tree with orders favoriting direction of my trade.
  - You can see order book and orders coming into exchange.  Lighter, means weak Order book.  Brighter, heavier orders are on book.

Remember, I'm Crypto Scalper, I hardly ever swing trade due to market conditions right now.  Look for long entry at bottom Val and short at VaH in range. Why you use a Range and Intraday trade until market back trending.  

Strategy concept pretty easy.  Google your friend and do little research or find book's.  Trading not Rocket Science, it's Art! Figure out what's best for you.  You should always be learning.  Always test new strategy!

Useful link I found long time ago.  Author highlights pretty much all confluences I listed above.  This will give you better idea of what's going on if your completely lost.

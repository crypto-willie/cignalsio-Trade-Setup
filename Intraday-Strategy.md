##### Intraday Scalp Strategy with [cignals.io](https://cignals.io)
******************************************************************
Before I discovered [cignals.io](https://cignals.io), I use combination confluences to build my strategy.  I'm new to order flow and still learning to read tape.  I've read few books recently, I some what understand it. I can't help you there. [cignals.io](https://cignals.io) can, it finds Imbalances for you, which is big part of tape reading.  What I do know, I can read Price Action, VSA, VPA, Volume Profile, & I understand theory behind SMC concept.  I've read few books on Wycoff theory. Using combination of these is how I trade.  I'm Crypto Scalper, I hardly even swing trade in this market. I prefer Range!  I trade off 30m, 15m, & 3m chart.

Here how I use [cignals.io](https://cignals.io) to my workflow.

 1. Determine trend
  - Look at 1D, 4H, 1H on signals for hints. "nPoC, EI, Buy-Side-Imbalance, Sell-Side-Imbalance, absorption etc etc"
  - Advance membership offers VWAP, Long & Short Ration, Open Interest, & more extra confluence on trades.

  - Picture of recent BTC chart, Like dream come true in my book!  You see something like this on any time frame!  It's area you defiantly pay attention to.  

2) Open 30m & 15m on [cignals.io](https://cignals.io), I change price Interval x4 of current Price Interval.  I like to see bigger picture of what's going on.
  - I usually use PoC, VaL, VaH from 30m.  Use 15m signals for key areas to pay attention too.
